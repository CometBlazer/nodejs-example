# NodeJS workshop

This is starter project for the following [Hackpost Guide workshop](https://www.hackpost.guide/users/cometblazer/post-773188064-setting-up-node-js).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node JS installed.

Next, use the following command to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CometBlazer/nodejs-example
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
